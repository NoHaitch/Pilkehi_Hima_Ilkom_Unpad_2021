## Background
After FCC(Five Cyber Community) successfully undergoing the election for Osis Chair at SMAN 5 Bandung, Belati Jagad, who was the head of FCC, was contacted by our senior, who at that time had already graduated and entered Unpad Communication Studies. Belati then invited me to participate in this project as both of us play a major role in the success at FCC. The main reason we were contacted was because they needed a cheap yet expirienced people to create a website for the election of the chairman of Hima Ikom Unpad and thus making us fit very well for the criteria.
